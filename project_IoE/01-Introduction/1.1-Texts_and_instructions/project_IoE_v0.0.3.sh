#Project Information on Energy
##############################Presentation
#The main goal is to develop human ways on using and upgrading its ways
#on energy and information, wich means understanding and keeping on track
#the databases and the power grids, as well the impact and range wich
#every information carries within.
##############################History_indent
#While I was developing my initial studies on the matter, Ive made n4rus.com,
#an web page containing some of the documents I wrote during the PI project,
#wich was an project that envisioned the launching of free information on the
#matters contained within the sites content and scope of intent.
#The aspects that I shall borrow from those, are the matters of improving our
#ways to generate, distribute, and use energy and information, as well the
#exploratory needings of our species, researching for the development of
#interstellar travell, exponentiation of humanity energetic resources in order
#to maximaze the individual range of reach.
##############################Object_list
#With those introductions made, we can list those objects to build:
#1: Energy generator & container
#2: Information database
#3: Computing and confronting Information against Energy
#4: Spaceship open source models
#5: Interstellar drive
#6: Gravity control technology
#7: Distribution grids new technology
#8: Isolated life support
#9: Artificial Ecosystems
#10: Task Oriented AI
#11: Human enhancement and protection suit
#12: Energy & Information peer gathering methods
#13: Human Knowledge Database & Acessment
##############################Directories_list
#The directories in the initial development phase:
#project_IoE
#||-PI
#|-Development
#|-Object_drafts
##############################Object_Description
#Each object draft has a development folder within its respective files
#Each draft shall have one or more pattent aplied from witch the developers
#must use as start-line.
#The goal is to improve humanity as well humans, then any information or
#relevant technology developed must be shared as open source or freeware,
#while other version is done within the organization scopes and pattents.
